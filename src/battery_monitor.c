/* BatteryMonitorInit
* Parameters: 
	int batt_mon_pin - pin number of the battery monitor pin
	int batt_mon_port - port of the battery monitor pin
* Author(s): mkobit
* Called by: Program that wants to use the battery monitor. This will be called before any other battery monitor usage.
* Purpose/Function Performed: Configures pin as open drain and stores the parameters in here for future use.
* Calling Convention: Delay library is expected to be set up before hand
	BatteryMonitorInit(IOPORT_F, BIT_2)
* Conditions at Exit: pin is configured as an open drain pin and configured as an output and should have released the bus. Resets the bus to check and see if device is connected.
	return int, if 1-wire device detected, returns 1, if not, returns 0
